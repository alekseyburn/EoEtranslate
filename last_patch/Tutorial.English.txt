        <string>Welcome to the battle system of Edge Of Eternity. When you come into contact with monsters on the field, you'll enter this battle phase.
[]
In a battle, your goal is to defeat your opponents by reducing their HP to 0.
[]
The status of your own characters comprises three gauges, HP (green), MP (blue) and ATB (white and red). If all your characters are reduced to 0 HP you'll lose the battle.
[]
During a battle, the ATB bar loads; when one of your characters, or one of your enemies, reaches 100% in the ATB bar, it is their turn.
[]
During each turn, the ATB bar stops loading until the end of the turn.
[]
When it's your turn, you can choose an action.
[]
When you damage an enemy, the damage is displayed on the screen.
[]
The status of your enemy is displayed above, and comprises two gauges, HP (green) and ATB (white and red). When the enemy has 0 HP they are defeated.
[]
Your enemy’s ATB is now full, it is their turn to choose an action.
[]
The enemy damaged you.
[]
Now, defeat your enemy using the attack action.
[]
You won your first battle. After winning a battle, the victory reward interface appears.
[]
After winning a battle, your character gains experience. When the XP bar (white) is full, your character levels up, becoming stronger.
[]
Your weapons also gain experience and level up, independently from characters.
[]
Your rewards are affected by your battle rating. You can earn a rating of 1 to 5 stars when you complete a battle’s optional objectives and defeat enemies quickly without any casualties.
[]
You earn Heyrs from battles: Heyrs are the currency of Heryon that are used to buy equipment and items. You can also see your battle time here: the battle time is the number of seconds (the time is counted only during ATB loading) that the battle lasts.
[]
You can loot up to two different items in a battle. Your rewards are affected by your battle rating and by completing optional battle objectives.</string>
